  - Imperative and object-oriented
  - Objects are first-class citizens
  - Nearly everything is mutable
  - Dynamically typed with a class-based type system
  - Strict evaluation
* What is Haskell?
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
  - Declarative and purely functional
  - Functions are first-class citizens
  - Functions are not allowed to have side effects (no state)
  - Based on abstract mathematics and lambda calculus
  - Statically typed with a strong type system
  - Lazy evaluation (non-strict evaluation)

** Recommended Way to Learn Haskell
   1. [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/][Learn You a Haskell]] (buy the book)
   2. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia][Typeclassopedia]] (dig into Haskell types)
   3. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/All_About_Monads][All About Monads]] (digs into each of the standard monads)
   4. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside][IO inside]] (understand IO and side effects)
   5. Review [[http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/][Real World Haskell]] (the online version, watch for typos)
** Things to Keep In Mind
   - If Haskell is your first purely functional language it might take
     some time to get out of your imperative skin
   - Haskell is based on abstract mathematical concepts such as
     [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory][category theory]] so expect to spend some time reviewing math texts
** Getting Help
   - Be sure to join the [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel][Haskell IRC channel]]
   - Send private messages to [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot][lambdabot]]
