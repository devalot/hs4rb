  - Declarative and purely functional
  - Functions are first-class citizens
  - Functions are not allowed to have side effects (no state)
  - Based on abstract mathematics and lambda calculus
  - Statically typed with a strong type system
  - Lazy evaluation (non-strict evaluation)
  - Compiled or interpreted
* Haskell Basics
** Syntax
   - Braces and semicolons *or*
   - Layout (use indentation like Python)
** Defining Functions
   - Name and arguments go on the left-hand side of the equals sign
   - The body of the function goes on the right-hand side
   - Functions must produce the same result given the same arguments
   - The only "data" a function can see are its arguments
   - The compiler can infer type information automatically
   - You can also manually specify type information
   - Giving explicit type information gives the compiler something to
     check against (what you expect vs. is really given)
** Function Types and Type Classes
   - When you give type information you can use:
     - Specific types (e.g. Int, Bool)
     - Type variables (e.g. a)
     - Type classes (e.g. Num a =>)
     - That is, functions can be polymorphic
** User Defined Types
   - Some types to review
     1. Bool
     2. Person (user-defined type in [[./src/types.hs][types.hs]])
     3. Maybe
   - Difference between type constructors and value constructors
   - Pattern matching and value constructors
** Some Real World Haskell
   - Implementing the Unix [[./src/wc.hs][wc]] utility
   - [[./src/rps.hs][Rock-paper-scissors]]
* Writing Better Ruby
  - Minimize side effects
  - Use fewer instance variables
* Learning Haskell

** Recommended Way to Learn Haskell
   1. [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/][Learn You a Haskell]] (buy the book)
   2. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia][Typeclassopedia]] (dig into Haskell types)
   3. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/All_About_Monads][All About Monads]] (digs into each of the standard monads)
   4. [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside][IO inside]] (understand IO and side effects)
   5. Review [[http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/][Real World Haskell]] (the online version, watch for typos)
** Things to Keep In Mind
   - If Haskell is your first purely functional language it might take
     some time to get out of your imperative skin
   - Haskell is based on abstract mathematical concepts such as
     [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory][category theory]] so expect to spend some time reviewing math texts
** Getting Help
   - Be sure to join the [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel][Haskell IRC channel]]
   - Send private messages to [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot][lambdabot]]
